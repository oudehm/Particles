This project is a C++ particle simulation using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The engine renders dynamic particles that interact with user inputs such as mouse clicks.
It allows users to spawn particles with random properties and perform transformations such as rotation, scaling, and translation. Additionally, the code includes unit tests for matrix 
operations used in the particle transformations.

Features
  - Particle Generation: Left-click on the window to spawn particles at the click location.
  - Particle Movement: Particles automatically rotate, scale, and move over time.
  - Matrix Transformations: Particles are transformed using matrix operations such as rotation, scaling, and translation.
  - Unit Tests: Includes unit tests for validating matrix transformations.
  - Interactive Simulation: Particles are deleted once their "time-to-live" (TTL) expires.
